# OpenAPI Generator Bazel

This repo was created to integrate the OpenAPI code generation CLI with Bazel.

## Quickstart

To use the Bazel bindings provided by this repo within a Bazel workspace,
you must do the following steps:

1. Add the following code to your WORKSPACE file at the root of your repository

   ```
   load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

   http_archive(
       name = "openapi_tools_generator_bazel",
       sha256 = "ada94694b10f2503c52a48427bd8589323bff5910bd1a7e5212ce34702d0af65",
       urls = ["https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-bazel/releases/download/v0.1.6/openapi-tools-generator-bazel-0.1.6.tar.gz"],
   )

   load("@openapi_tools_generator_bazel//:defs.bzl", "openapi_tools_generator_bazel_repositories")

   # You can provide any version of the CLI that has been uploaded to Maven
   openapi_tools_generator_bazel_repositories(
       openapi_generator_cli_version = "5.1.0",
       sha256 = "62f9842f0fcd91e4afeafc33f19a7af41f2927c7472c601310cedfc72ff1bb19"
   )
   ```

2. Create a BUILD.bazel file next to the .yaml file you wish to generate code from.
   The below example generates a go library within a generated directory named `petstore_go`

```
load("@openapi_tools_generator_bazel//:defs.bzl", "openapi_generator")

openapi_generator(
    name = "petstore_go",
    generator = "go",
    spec = "petstore.yaml",
)
```
